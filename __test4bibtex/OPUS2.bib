Combinatorial optimization problems expressed
as {\em Boolean constraint satisfaction problems} (BCSPs)
arise in several contexts, ranging from
the classical unate set-packing problems to the binate minimum cover
problems, including the
{\em Haplotype Inference by Pure Parsimony} (HIPP) problem.
For years, publications on special purpose BCSP solvers 
have been comparing their performance to 
the more general-purpose LP-solver {\it cplex} that also takes
instances of BCSPs. Not surprisingly, `experimental results' of special
purpose solvers would dominate the performance of {\it cplex} --
until a recent publication demonstrated the opposite trend on some of the instances.

In this brief talk we demonstrate
how  {\em the scientific method} can be applied to comparing the performance 
of not only BCSP solvers but also other solvers that address NP-hard problems.
The approach is founded on two premises: 
(1) the introduction of
instance isomorphs as families of equivalence classes, based on randomized replicas of
a given reference instance, and 
(2) the use of isomorph classes for the design of
reproducible experiments with BCSP solvers that includes
performance testing hypotheses. We introduce a number of BCSP reference instances from
different domains, generate isomorph classes and use  {\it cplex}  to
characterize the solver performance and the isomorph classes themselves.
Instances and results with supporting software utilities are posted on the Web.
By adopting the proposed methodology, solver developers may find it easier to 
(1) {\em reliably} improve the performance of their solvers
and, 
(2) report results of their experiments under the proposed schema.

This is a joint work with Jason Osborne and Matt Stallmann.

	Abstract = {
Given a Boolean satisfiability (\sat) problem whose variables have non-negative weights,
the minimum-cost satisfiability (\mincostsat) problem finds a satisfying truth assignment
that minimizes a weighted sum of the truth values of the variables. Many NP-optimization
problems are either special cases of \mincostsat\ or can be transformed into \mincostsat\
efficiently. However, in the past, these problems have been largely considered in
isolation. In this dissertation, we (1)~classify existing~\mincostsat\ problems,
(2)~study factors affecting the performance of \mincostsat\ solvers, (3)~propose
algorithms for \mincostsat\ problems, and (4)~implement and validate the performance of
state-of-the-art solvers for special cases of \mincostsat, including set and binate
covering, \maxsat, and \gpmaxsat.

We categorize \mincostsat\ problems as either native or non-native. Non-native problems
can only be transformed into \mincostsat\ by adding slack variables. These problems
include the \maxsat, \pmaxsat, and \gpmaxsat\ problems which have applications ranging
from course assignment to FPGA detailed routing. Native problems are various sub-cases of
\mincostsat. We further divide these into two groups: covering problems and non-covering
problems. The covering problems include the unate or set covering and the binate covering
problems. They have applications in Operations Research (e.g., routing and scheduling)
and logic synthesis (e.g., logic minimization and finite state machine minimization). In
the covering problems, all or most clauses contain no complemented variables and a
feasible solution is relatively easy to find. The non-covering problems contain clauses
that are highly constrained, and sometimes only a small fraction of the variables are
weighted. The non-covering problems have applications in minimum-size test pattern and
minimum-length plans.

We study two important performance factors, among others, in
branch-and-bound \mincostsat\ solvers. They are the lower-bounding and upper-bounding
strategies. For lower bounding, we incorporate two advanced techniques: linear
programming relaxation and cutting planes. Both methods can provide much higher quality
lower-bounds than previous methods based on maximum independent sets of rows. For upper
bounding, we show that our local-search \mincostsat\ solver, when initialized and
terminated properly, can find the best upper-bound quickly.

Other techniques that contribute to the engineering of state-of-the-art solvers for
applications of \mincostsat\ are also introduced.  This work has led to the development
of (1)~a solver for covering problems that consistently outperforms previous leading
solvers by as much as two orders of magnitude, (2)~a logic minimizer that is able to
solve three benchmark problems whose solution has eluded solvers for more than a decade,
(3)~a \maxsat\ solver that challenges the dominance of linear programming solvers,
particularly \cplex, on \maxtwosat\ benchmarks, and (4)~a stochastic local-search solver
for \gpmaxsat\ (with applications to FPGA routing) that finds known optima quickly and is
able to find better than previously-known solutions on benchmarks whose optima remain
unknown.

This paper presents a class software project that was part of a 
recent experimental graduate course on 
{\em Frontiers of Collaborative Computing on the Internet}. 
We chose Tcl/Tk to facilitate rapid prototyping, testing,
and demonstrating all phases of the project.
The major milestones achieved during this course are:

~{\large $\bullet$} rapid proficiency in Tcl/Tk that allowed each student 
to manipulate
data and widgets, apply socket programming principles, and create
a progression of client/server applications, from textbook 
cases to a  unique client/server architecture prototype  -- 
driven by and matched to a well-defined collaborative project driver.

~{\large $\bullet$} universal server that supports any number of 
user-configurable clients, each accessible through a Web-browser
on a Mac, Windows, or UNIX platforms.  Prototype client configurations 
include:
(1) collaborative document composition, (2) collaborative
Tcl/Tk debugging and compilation, (3) collaborative
design workflow.

Ghosh, Debabrata. {\em 
Generation of Tightly Controlled Equivalence Classes 
for Experimental Design of Heuristics for Graph--Based
NP-hard Problems} \\
(Under the direction of Dr. Franc Brglez.)

Computer-aided design (CAD) of VLSI circuits relies on heuristics that
optimize cost functions related to a graph model of a circuit. Since the
problems are typically NP-hard, the quality of solutions can vary
significantly. The current methodology to evaluate the performance of such
heuristics is not at the level of {\em experimental design} that is the norm in
disciplines such as bio-medical sciences and others.  A major impediment is
the lack of well-defined equivalence classes of circuits.  Comparison
of two heuristics based on a number of unrelated, single instances of
circuits is flawed -- it can be shown that any incremental improvements
that are observed may well be offset by variations induced by a number of
isomorphic instances of the same circuit.

The goal of this thesis is to introduce a method to synthesize, for any
{\em reference circuit}, a well-defined and tightly controlled circuit class to
support experimental design methodology for problems such as partitioning,
placement, and routing. Each member of the class must be sufficiently
`close' to its reference circuit: if the reference is a multiplier, all
circuits in the class should have a multiplier-like structure. Such tight
control has not been achieved in earlier research. Characterizations such
as the same number of vertices and nets (hyperedges), the same
number of levels, the 
same Rent's
exponent are necessary but not sufficient. The control that we need is
\thispagestyle{empty}
achieved by characterizing the graph in terms of a {\em well-defined order}.
Significantly, we demonstrate that an equivalent characteristic graph
ordering can be achieved by minimizing any of the following cost functions:
(1) crossing number, (2) netspan number, or (3) cellspan number. This
brings out the difficulty of the characterization problem: finding such an
order is NP-hard.

We address the ordering problem of the reference graph $G$ with an
effective heuristic that finds the order of the {\em characteristic spanning
tree} $st(G)$ and show that the crossing number of  $G$ and $st(G)$ are
tightly correlated for graphs that represent typical VLSI circuits. The
characteristic signature of the graph now includes the order of the
spanning tree and the netspan number corresponding to this order.

We develop a synthesis method such that each member of the circuit class, a
{\em sibling}, satisfies this signature. Siblings retain all significant
characteristics of their reference circuit. We demonstrate the scalability
of the proposed approach through a number of experiments.
The sibling classes are shown to have results within $\pm (4-9)$\%
of the parent circuit -- under all physical design tools at our
disposal.

Traditionally, a stand-alone client application is rendered collaborative
for members of a team either
by sharing its view or by re-writing it as a collaborative client.
However, it may not be possible to anticipate in advance all 
preferences for collaboration, hence such a client 
may appear confusing to some of the team members.

We propose a novel client/server architecture for tk-based
applications: rendering any stand-alone client collaborative,
without a code re-write. Participants themselves are allowed to
dynamically re-configure the inter-client synchronization table
to suit their changing preferences and needs.
The \texttt{CollabWiseTk} toolkit, based on the proposed architecture,
is an extension of the tk functionality to 
support collaboration. It re-defines the existing tk commands
such that the entire tk widget set is rendered collaborative for use
with multiple users. 

We demonstrate the capabilities of the \texttt{CollabWiseTk} toolkit

most of the {\em Tk Widget Demonstrations},

Taskflow-oriented programming merges concepts from structured
programming, hardware description, and mark-up languages. 
A mark-up language such as XML supports a well-defined schema that can
capture the  decomposition of a program into a hierarchy of tasks. A
hardware description language such as VHDL relies on well-defined and
explicit input/output port definitions to create, at any level of
hierarchy, explicit data dependencies among tasks. A structured programming
language provides control to sequence the execution of all
tasks. We apply these concepts to the design of a distributed user-configurable
environment that supports project-specific collaborative, networked, and
taskflow-oriented programming as well as computing. Starting with the top-down
decomposition of a computing project into task, we capture not only the
hierarchy of tasks but also {\em explicit and user-defined} dependencies, i.e. 
directed \verb+task=>task+ control edges. Data dependencies are created
implicitly only during the detailed bottom-up implementation of input/output
assignments for each task.

Task-flow programming is not about programming the tasks. Rather, it is about
programming dependency edges between the tasks, \verb+task=>task+ control edges
in particular. An executable program  is  written simply as a
(hierarchical) taskflow in XML, interconnecting tasks and data. 
Most
\verb+task=>task+ edges are in the 'enabled' state by default and require no
programming, while conditions to
`enable/disable' the state of \verb+task=>task+ edges are  short and simple and
are an integral part of the task node encapsulation.  
Similarly, the \verb+data->task+ and \verb+task->data+ edges are always
`enabled'.

Kapur, Nevin. Cell Placement and Minimization of Crossing Numbers

We conjecture that good column-based placements can be produced by
minimizing {\em two} wire crossing numbers:

channel, and 
(2) the maximum wire crossing on the imaginary cutlines that separate
cells on the opposite ends of the channels.
We leverage the canonical form

WAve  Synthesis of Permissible mutation functions, WASP, is a
heuristic with an objective to minimize the nodes and the
levels of an acyclic multiple level boolean network of 2-input nodes.
WASP transforms a multi-input, multi-output perturbation region of wires
${\cal P}_j$ into a single-level mutation subcircuit ${\cal M}_j$ and  
a remainder subcircuit ${\cal R}_j$. The transformations include
the concept of minimum cost permissible mutation subcircuit
${\cal M}_j$, formed by replacing each pair of wires that are perturbable
by a set of 255 mutation functions. Since we can precompute and store
all possible 2$^{12}$-1 perturbation indices that map into
255 mutation indices ranked into 8 equivalent cost classes, we
can determine the minimum cost mutation by a simple table look-up,
given the 4-tuple of permissible perturbation indices.

Unlike methods that rely on truth tables (ROBDDs), the methods proposed
here can exploit efficient ATPG techniques and can thus more rapidly scale
to circuits with the larger number of inputs.

Today, typical experiments that report `performance' of EDA algorithms
are based on isolated instances of circuit benchmarks.
In this paper, we design and report results of experiments that use
a `large number' of sample circuits from several
`equivalence classes'.
We consider a number of known circuit benchmarks and construct
large samples of circuits that belong to the same
equivalence class. Specifically, we examine properties of the recently
introduced equivalence class of signature-invariant
'mutants' eta\_i in N\_sigma\_0 (i > 0), where
the signature sigma\_0 is based on a single reference circuit eta\_0.

The main goals of the experiments in this paper are:
(1) to introduce a methodology that objectively measures the
performance of algorithms used repeatedly in typical EDA tools,
(2) to critically examine data sets that can be or should be used
to support such a methodology.
We argue that the proposed selection of mutants from the respective
equivalence class represents an important set of
benchmarks
since we can consistently show that
design objectives, being optimized by various algorithms,
behave as random variables and give rise to well-defined
`distributions of circuit mutants'.

This paper addresses the problem of true delay estimation during high level design. The true delay is the delay of the longest sensitizable path in the resulting circuit, as opposed to the topological delay, which is the delay of the longest path in the circuit. The existing delay estimation techniques either estimate the topological delay, which may be pessimistic if the longest path is unsensitizable or false, or estimate the true delay using gate-level timing analysis, which may be prohibitively expensive.

In this paper, we introduce an efficient technique to compute an estimate of the true delay. The proposed technique relies on partitioning the paths in the curcuit and topological delay computation,  and not on path sensitization.

We have developed a Functional delay ESTimation tool, FEST, and present experimental results.

	Abstract = {{
Continuous advances in semiconductor technology and in the integration level of the
fabricated circuits have enhanced many features, increased the performance and improved
the reliability of electronic devices. Computer-Aided Design (CAD) techniques play a major
role in supporting this development. CAD tools increased the designer's productivity with an
efficient management of the design projects and by automatically performing time-extensive
tasks. 

The work presented in this thesis has been motivated by the need to provide digital system
designers capability of enhancing the following important steps of VLSI design: fault
modeling and test generation, and logic synthesis and optimization. We have introduced the
concept of detectable perturbations which form the generic basis for these problems. 

Detectable perturbations are based on decoding k wires and perturbing p wires (k-in-p
perturbations). Special cases for fault modeling and logic optimization were considered. We
have proposed efficient ways for evaluating detectable perturbations by modifying and
upgrading the existing gate-level fault simulators and hierarchical test generators for single
stuck-at faults. The concept of adjoint logic nodes for efficient evaluation of observability
functions at the inputs of the complex modules was introduced. We have shown that the
perturbations may introduce cycles and asynchronous behaviour similar as in the case of
feedback bridging faults. We have analyzed this phenomena and provide necessary and
sufficient conditions for oscillation induced. 

The concept of detectable perturbations was applied for modeling of various traditional and
non-traditional technology-specific faults first. We have shown that the single stuck-at fault
model is inadequate for testing the circuits with logic modules implementing complex
function. The single stuck-at fault model is complete only if all logic is implemented as
simple 2-input (AND, NAND, OR, NOR) cells. In this case, three patterns are sufficient to
test all single stuck-at faults on wires of each embedded call and to distinguish between all of
the functions implemented by this cells. However, with additional cells in the library
implementing the logic, the single stuck-at fault model can no longer support complete
functionality test of an embedded cell. For example, consider a cell, such as 2-input XOR.
While any 3 patterns will also test all single stuck-at faults on the I/O pins of the XOR cells,
we may not distinguish between OR or XOR cell unless we test for all minterms and
maxterms in both functions. Without a complete functionality test, an internal fault in the
XOR cell could escape this detection. 

This observations motivated us for introduction of functionality fault model which is based
on the complete enumeration of the truth table of each logic module. Since the average fanin
of logic modules implemented in CMOS standard cell, mask programmable, or field
programmable gate arrays technology, in current designs typically ranges between 3 and 4,
functionality fault model is thus entirely feasible and enhances the quality of the test
significantly. Tests based on this model provide complete coverage of module's behavior,
interior faults as well as input stuck-at and bridging faults of any multiplicity and as such
reduce the need for technology-specific fault models. 

Experimental results obtained on a set of technology-mapped cells confirmed the feasibility
of the functionality fault model. By applying the same number of random trials targeting the
functionality and the single stuck-at fault model, we retain about twice as many test patterns
for the functionality fault model and improve functionality fault coverage. In addition, the
list of don't cares generated as a side product can be used to simplify the design, resulting in
a smaller and more testable circuit. This provides further opportunities for logic synthesis
and optimization before and after technology mapping step. 

Test generation for multi-output embedded modules is discussed next. We have shown that
the new class of faults should be considered. We address the problem of testing for
multi-faults by considering the problem of detecting functionality mutations on wires as well
as on logic nodes. The space of mutation faults, even without considering mutations of logic
nodes, grows exponentially with the number of wires under consideration. Just for a pair
wires, we can consider 255 cases of distinct 2-input 2-output functionality mutations. The
important finding of this thesis is that all functionality mutations can be covered by test
patterns that detect all detectable perturbations which are much lower bound as the size of
functionality mutations. We have shown that single, pairwise stuck-at and bridging faults are
only special cases of such mutations. 

Experimental results were obtained on three equivalent set of netlists: initial, optimized and
technology-mapped. We have evaluated the efficiency of various fault models and drew some
insightful conclusions. Tests based on single stuck-at faults are clearly not adequate when
considering coverage of non-traditional technology-specific faults that may be hard to model
explicitly. In contrast, tests that cover all possible perturbations will also cover all possible
mutations of each multi-output module, including module functionality as well as wiring
faults on module boundary. The number of all perturbations considered in the set of
benchmark circuits was about 2.36 times the size of the set of all single stuck-at faults in the
gate level representation of the technology mapped circuits. This confirms that test
generation based on the detectable perturbation paradigm is comprehensive and less
expensive than alternative and incomplete strategies, such as extensions to much larger sets of
layout-specific pairwise bridging faults. 

While the detectable perturbations form a basis for fault modeling and test generation, we
have demonstrated that the permissible (undetectable) perturbations form a basis for logic
synthesis and optimization in terms of area of technology independent networks. The basic
steps of the concept are the following: 

    1. Starting at primary inputs, we introduce a perturbation region P\_1 as a set of directed
      wires that connect primary inputs to the inputs of the original circuit, designated as a
      remainder R\_1.
    2. Given the perturbation region P\_1, we assign to each wire pair, a set of 2-in-2
      detectable perturbations and determine which, if any, of these perturbations are
      undetectable. We denote the set of all undetectable perturbations as permissible
      perturbations.
    3. From the set of all permissible perturbations in  P\_1, we synthesize the lowest cost
      permissible mutation subcircuit M\_1 that now replaces the wires in the perturbation
      region  P\_1, without changing the functionality of the original circuit. 

At this point, the three steps of the procedure above, denoted as WASP (WAve Synthesis of
Permissible Functions) can be repeated, starting at the outputs of the permissible mutation
subcircuit  M\_1. 

Wave synthesis relies on the original multi-level netlist representation which is commonly
used by test generation and fault simulation tools and is known to be effective for large
circuits, regardless of the functionality of the circuit. In case that any permissible
perturbations were detected in the initial perturbation region, several methods for increasing
the number of output wires were considered.We have extended the proposed approach also
for multi-output circuits and experimental results on random and existing benchmark circuits
confirmed the proposed concepts. The optimized unmapped and technology-mapped circuits
exhibits smaller area and, in most cases less delay as the original unmapped and mapped
circuits.

Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) technology has facilitated low-cost
implementation of powerful digital circuits. Steady advances in
semiconductor technology and in the integration level of integrated
circuits (ICs) have enhanced many features, increased the performance,
improved reliability of electronic equipment, and, at the same time,
reduced the cost, power consumption, and system size. As the size and
complexity of digital system increase, more computer aided design (CAD)
tools are introduced into hardware design process. The early 
paper-and-pencil design methods have given way to sophisticated design 
entry, verification, and automatic hardware generation tools. The
use of interactive and automatic design tools has increased 
the designer's productivity significantly with an efficient management of
the design project and by automatically performing a 
huge amount of time-extensive tasks. The designer heavely relies on
software tools for nearly every aspect of the development cycle, from
the circuit specification and design entry to the performance
analyses, layout generation and verification. 

This thesis considers the problem of obtaining a minimum-cost and
minimum-delay partitioning of large logic circuit into a collection of
subcircuits, such that each subcircuit will fit into some device
selected from a given library. Each device in the library may have 
different price, size, terminal capacity and intrinsic delays associated
with it. This work has been motivated by a need to provide digital
system designers with a capability to implement large circuits that do
not fit into any one of the commercially available IC devices, such
as FPGA devices. Automatic partitioning software is needed to relieve 
the designers from the tedious task of partitioning the design manually 
in such situations. 

The main result of the performed research is a partitioning algorithm 
based on a recursive application of the Fiduccia-Matheyses bipartitioning
heuristic. This heuristic has been amended
with appropriate extensions to handle (a) the overall goal of cost and
delay minimization, and optimization for performance and (b) the 
constraints reflecting the limitations on the 
capacity of IC devices. Although the formulation and the implementation 
are general, we demonstrated the application of our method using circuits
generated with the commercial tool and partitioned for implementation with
specific library of Xilinx's FPGA devices.

The experimental partitioning software, 'PROP' and 'TPR', developed
in the course of the reported work, has exhibited a very encouraging performance,
being able to produce solutions with cost very similar to the theoretical 
minimum calculated for many of the benchmark circuit. 

After the short introduction, the thesis begins with the discussion on basic 
definitions and models that are used throughout the thesis. The logic circuit
is modeled as a hypergraph, which is represented as a supermatrix that 
bears the information of all most important topological and performance 
properties of the logic circuit under consideration. A k-way circuit
partitioning problem implies an assignment of interior nodes of the hypergraph
into a set of $k$ non-overlapping hypergraphs, each of which meets the constraints,
imposed by technology limitations of devices from a given device library. 
The main goal of the partitioning is not only to derive a feasible
implementation of the circuit, but also to minimize a specific circuit
design objective, such as an implementation for minimum cost, minimum
delay or minimum interconnect between the resulting devices. The problem is 
considered as a NP-complete combinatorial problem, which can be approximately 
solved by the use of heuristic methods.   

The proposed heuristic k-way partitioning algorithm is based on recursive application
of bipartitioning. In first iteration, the entire design is partitioned
into one feasible partition, that meets the constraint of at least one
device from the library, and the remainder partition. Subsequent iterations
apply the same procedure to the remainder partitions, until all resulting
partitions meet the constraints of given IC devices. The partitioner targets such 
implementation  of the circuit into multiple devices that the total cost of
the devices used is minimized. We provide the calculation of the lower
bound on the total device cost, which represents the fundamental
reference point, by solving the integer linear programming (ILP)
problem. Solution of the ILP problem can be viewed as a `target
distribution' of library device counts; any feasible implementation utilizing
the target device distribution would produce a minimum-cost implementation.
During partitioning, the ILP problem is solved for each remainder partition, 
and the resulting device distribution guides the partitioning process towards
the minimum-cost implementation. 

The cost of the final k-way partitions obtained with a recursive bipartitoning
method strongly depends on the constraints that becomes active during each 
bipartitioning stage. Since any connection that connects two partitions, 
increases the total terminal count, the limitations on I/O terminal counts of 
IC devices may constraint the partitioner from achieving the minimum-cost solution.
Therefore, minimizing the increase in the terminal count during each
bipartitioning stage, which is closely coupled with the minimization of 
interconnects between partitions, will tend to produce cheaper final 
partitions. We introduced the concept of `functional replication'
along with the unified cost model for min-cut partitioning with replication,
that significantly increase the potential of reducing the number of interconnects
between partitions. As it is demonstrated, the concept overcomes some typical 
problems that are introduced with the size of cluster nodes and traditional node
replications. A set of experimental results generated on a huge 
set of benchmark circuits provides a comparison of  our approach to 
others and clearly demonstrates the optimization trend of contributions. 

The concept of functional replication not only reduces the size of the
interconnects beyond the traditional approach but also raises the amount
of logic and reconvergence. The overhead of the logic due to the 
replication may result an oposit effect; activating the size constraint 
during each bipartitioning stage may prevent achieving the minimum-cost
implementation. On a contrary, partitions based on signal reconvergence 
have been shown to lead to much improved logic optimization results for
large circuits. Therefore, we introduced the 
`recursive bipartitioning paradigm PROP', which combines concepts from 
logic synthesis that target minimization of the logic, with the recursive 
bipartitioning. While it can be shown that either 'replication'
or `optimization' can improve the quality of partitions, it is the
combination of processes that consistently achieves the best results to
date. Although the formulation and the 
implementation are general, we demonstrated the application of our method 
using circuits generated with a commercial tool and partitioned for 
implementation with specific library of Xilinx's FPGA devices. All
contributions have been justified through the comprehensive report on 
the experimental work. 

One of the most important objective in design process is an implementation
of a digital circuit for optimal performance. We amended the proposed
k-way partitioning algorithm with the concepts from performance optimization
that target the minimization of critical delay in a circuit. After developing
the delay sensitivity model that compute the change of a critical delay
from the local information; at the source of a local transformation which
modifies the delays, we applied the model and built it into k-way partitioning
heuristic that target the minimization of a critical delay in addition to
the minimum cost implementation. Experimental results demonstrate the 
efficiency of the proposed approach. 

We concluded the thesis with the conclusions and directions for future work.

The goal of high level synthesis is to automate the synthesis
of a VLSI circuit from its algorithmic description. Successful high
level synthesis methodologies exist for arithmetic-intensive designs.
This dissertation targets issues in synthesis
of `control-intensive designs' which may contain nested
conditional statements and nested loops.
Major tasks in high level synthesis include
allocation, scheduling, assignment, and register transfer
level (RTL) circuit generation.
The objective of performing these tasks efficiently is to produce circuits
optimized for cost functions such as delay, area and testability.

The time required to execute the algorithmic specification
by the synthesized circuit
is a product of the number of clock cycles required to execute
the specification and the clock period of the circuit.
We propose techniques which target efficient scheduling of operations in
loops
to minimize the number of clock cycles required to execute the
specification (algorithm `LDS').
To produce circuits with a small clock period,
traditional techniques use more resources or faster resources.
We demonstrate that even when the resource allocation is fixed,
the clock period of the circuit can be minimized using
assignment techniques (algorithm `ClkMin').

An RTL circuit is generated following the scheduling and assignment phases.
The RTL designs produced may not be optimized for area, and may not
be completely testable at the gate level.
We propose a general methodology to generate RTL designs optimized for area
which uses the hierarchy of the RTL design
and the interaction between control and data path (algorithm `WONDER').
The optimized RTL circuits are completely testable under
full-scan at the gate level.

In general, there may be multiple solutions to the scheduling, assignment
and RTL generation tasks. Hence fast and accurate estimation tools
are essential to evaluate the quality
of different possible implementations.
Good techniques exist for area estimation. In this dissertation, we develop
efficient techniques for estimating the number of clock cycles
required to execute a specification and the clock period of the
implementation.
We apply Markov chain techniques
for computing the expected number of clock cycles required by a schedule
to execute the complete algorithmic specification for various possible
inputs
(algorithm `PERSIS').
The clock period estimation technique uses high level information
about scheduling and assignment to compute the true delay
as opposed to the `topological' delay of the implementation (algorithm
`FEST').

The algorithms developed in this dissertation have been integrated
in the SECONDS high level synthesis system. `SECONDS'
has successfully produced circuit descriptions from
control-intensive algorithmic specifications. Experiments with `SECONDS'
demonstrate that high level synthesis can create competitive designs
but reduces design time significantly.

        is expended repeatedly. Therefore, in order to minimize the total cost
        of testing, the optimum strategy is one that minimizes the cost of test
        generation as well as the test sequence length. This research presents
        a strategy which attempts to reduce both the cost of generating a test
        as well as the time required to apply this test.

        The key to dynamic scan testing is the fact that we supplement
        an existing sequential circuit, called the object machine,
        with a scannable test machine to improve controllability and
        observability of internal machine states. Another key is a novel
        dynamic algorithm for test generation which takes advantage of the
        knowledge of the test machine hardware to reduce test generation costs
        and the overall length of the test sequence.

        This thesis introduces a new cellular scan test machine which is found
        to perform well within the dynamic testing paradigm.  It is a test
        machine which connects the flip-flops into one or more circular chains
        with each chain containing an exclusive-or gate at the beginning of the
        chain. One input of each exclusive-or, is directly controllable from
        the circuit inputs.

        The thesis also presents a dynamic scan test generation algorithm,
        DYNASTEE, which reduces the {\em average} test sequence length per
        fault when compared to existing static test generation algorithms for
        scan architectures. It allows the mode control pin to cycle freely
        between object and test machine operation as required. The scan
        register is shifted for minimal time to reach a state required for
        testing.  Test sequence length is further optimized via a scan chain
        ordering algorithm.

        This thesis demonstrates the flexibility of dynamic scan testing by
        presenting it's effectiveness for both partial and multiple scan chains
        as well as introducing a technique for random test generation. The
        thesis concludes with results of experiments which validate the theory
        that dynamic scan testing can significantly reduce the cost of testing
        scan testing can significantly reduce the cost of testing and is a
        viable alternative to traditional static scan testing approaches.}},
